GREEN FLAGS:
+ Q3 FY26 revenue Rs 830 Cr (+17% YoY, Screener.in)
+ EBITDA margin expanding +430 bps YoY
+ ROCE 18.2% (Screener.in), strong brand in packaged snacks
+ Rural recovery + FMCG channel penetration thesis
+ CFO growing: Rs 57 Cr (FY22) -> Rs 193 Cr (FY25)

RED FLAGS:
- P/E 65.9x — premium valuation (Screener.in)

- Competitive intensity from ITC, Haldiram's
- Input cost inflation risk (edible oils, palm oil)

### 2. SULA VINEYARDS (Rs 185) — HOLD

GREEN FLAGS:
+ India's largest wine producer (>50% market share)
+ Wine tourism growing 21.2% YoY
+ DIIs accumulating (9% -> 18.2%)
+ Premiumization trend in wine industry

RED FLAGS:
- Q1 FY26 PAT crashed 87% to Rs 1.94 Cr
- Revenue CAGR 3.6% vs wine market 14-16% = market share erosion
- CFO halved: Rs 121 Cr (FY24) -> Rs 58 Cr (FY25) (Screener.in)
- Debtor days surged: 81 (FY23) -> 148 (FY25) (Screener.in)

- ROCE: 13.2% (Screener.in), declining

VERDICT: HOLD. Expected value Rs 261 (~41% upside, but high uncertainty). *Assumption: Bear probability raised to 40% due to working capital deterioration. Bull case depends on wine market structural growth thesis.*

+ Rs 2,350 Cr cash — funded for growth
+ CFO positive and growing despite losses: Rs 1,644 Cr FY25 (Screener.in)

RED FLAGS:

- ROCE: -2.87% (Screener.in)
- Rs 3,500+ Cr debt post-demerger (lease liabilities)
- Pantaloons core growing only 6%
- TTM revenue not directly comparable (pre vs post demerger)

VERDICT: SPECULATIVE HOLD. Expected value around CMP. *Assumption: Uses EV/Sales (not P/E) since loss-making. CFO is positive due to lease accounting (depreciation on RoU assets). Bear probability 40%.*

+ Heritage brands: Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly, Peter England
+ 3,300 stores, 4.7M sq ft retail space
+ Q3 FY26 EBITDA margin improving
+ CFO Rs 1,144 Cr in FY25 (Screener.in)

RED FLAGS:

- Newly listed (2025) — limited standalone track record
- Revenue growth moderate 5-10%
- Expected value Rs 97 is BELOW CMP Rs 116
- Brand-level revenue splits not publicly disclosed

VERDICT: HOLD. Expected value Rs 97 (~16% downside). *Assumption: EV < CMP, so verdict is HOLD per framework rules. Individual brand revenue splits are illustrative only — not disclosed by company. Forward P/E uses 30-85x range given newly listed status.*

### 5. CELLO WORLD (Rs 505) — ACCUMULATE

GREEN FLAGS:

+ 75% promoter holding (Screener.in)

RED FLAGS:
- FCF negative every year FY22-FY25 (capex for glass/steel plants)
- Cash conversion cycle 245 days — elevated for consumer products
- Operating margins contracted
- Capex-heavy phase: Rs 553 Cr in FY25

VERDICT: ACCUMULATE. Expected value Rs 617 (~22% upside). *Assumption: Negative FCF is cyclical, not structural. Management guides capex to normalize from Rs 553 Cr (FY25) to Rs 75 Cr maintenance (FY27). Normalized FCF ~Rs 187 Cr. Bear P/E uses 18-24x (commodity-company floor).*

Expected return barely exceeds risk-free rate (~7%).*
