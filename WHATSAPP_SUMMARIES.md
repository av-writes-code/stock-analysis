### 1. BIKAJI FOODS (Rs 660) — ACCUMULATE

GREEN FLAGS:
+ Q3 FY26 revenue Rs 830 Cr (+17% YoY, Screener.in)
+ EBITDA margin expanding +430 bps YoY
+ ROCE 18.2% (Screener.in), strong brand in packaged snacks
+ Rural recovery + FMCG channel penetration thesis
+ CFO growing: Rs 57 Cr (FY22) -> Rs 193 Cr (FY25)

RED FLAGS:
- P/E 65.9x — premium valuation (Screener.in)
- Cash conversion ratio declined: 65% (FY24) -> 45% (FY25)
- Competitive intensity from ITC, Haldiram's
- Input cost inflation risk (edible oils, palm oil)

VERDICT: ACCUMULATE. Expected value Rs 756 (~14.5% upside). *Assumption: Forward EPS uses base case 18% PAT growth, P/E 55-65x anchored to FMCG peer average. Our EV is conservative vs consensus (Rs 890-900) because we assign 25% bear probability.*

### 2. SULA VINEYARDS (Rs 185) — HOLD

GREEN FLAGS:
+ India's largest wine producer (>50% market share)
+ Wine tourism growing 21.2% YoY
+ DIIs accumulating (9% -> 18.2%)
+ Premiumization trend in wine industry

RED FLAGS:
- Q1 FY26 PAT crashed 87% to Rs 1.94 Cr
- Revenue CAGR 3.6% vs wine market 14-16% = market share erosion
- CFO halved: Rs 121 Cr (FY24) -> Rs 58 Cr (FY25) (Screener.in)
- Debtor days surged: 81 (FY23) -> 148 (FY25) (Screener.in)
- Inventory days 877 — significant working capital stress
- ROCE: 13.2% (Screener.in), declining

EU-INDIA FTA UPDATE (Jan 27, 2026):
- India-EU FTA SIGNED. Wine tariffs to drop from 150% -> 75% (Year 1), then to 20-30% over 7-10 years.
- No concession on wines below EUR 2.5/bottle — protects ~90% of Indian wines under Rs 1,500.
- Sula stock fell 4.1% on announcement day.
- Sula's filing says "limited impact" and calls it "balanced" — company could also distribute EU wines.
- BUT: Wine imports already grew 50%+ in H1 2025. Long-term competitive pressure is real.
- Sources: Business Standard (Jan 28, 2026), BusinessToday, CNBC

ANALYST TARGETS:
- Consensus (5 analysts): Rs 265, Buy (3 Buy / 2 Hold)
- TradingView (4 analysts): Rs 290, range Rs 268-330
- CLSA target of Rs 819 is STALE (May 2024, pre-earnings decline) — likely revised down
- Implied upside to consensus: ~43% — but cautious sentiment (only 3/5 Buy)

VERDICT: HOLD. Expected value Rs 261 (~41% upside, but high uncertainty). *Assumption: Bear probability raised to 40% due to working capital deterioration + EU FTA competitive risk. Bull case depends on wine market structural growth thesis. CLSA Rs 819 target excluded as stale.*

- Bernstein: Range Rs 80-105
- Consensus (4 brokers): ~Rs 92, Neutral
- Alpha Spread: Intrinsic value Rs 183 (61% undervalued) — Jan 2026

VERDICT: SPECULATIVE HOLD. Expected value around CMP. *Assumption: Uses EV/Sales (not P/E) since loss-making. CFO is positive due to lease accounting (depreciation on RoU assets). Bear probability 40%. Most analysts are Neutral/Hold — not bearish, not bullish.*

Our model assigns 30% bear probability at 30-40x P/E given newly listed premium risk. Analyst targets are significantly higher — investors should weigh both views.*

Management guides capex to normalize from Rs 553 Cr (FY25) to Rs 75 Cr maintenance (FY27). Normalized FCF ~Rs 187 Cr. Bear P/E uses 18-24x (commodity-company floor). All 6 covering analysts rate Buy.*
